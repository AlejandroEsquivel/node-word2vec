# Usage

## API

### .word2phrases(input, output, params)


The `params` parameter expects a JS object optionally containing some of the following keys and associated values. If they are not supplied, the default values are used.


| Key        |   Description           | Default Value |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| minCount      | discard words appearing less than *minCount* times | 5 |
| threshold      | determines the number of phrases, higher value means less phrases   | 100 |
| debug         | sets debug mode      | 2 |

### .word2vec(input, output, params)

| Key        |   Description           | Default Value |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| size      | sets the size of word vectors| 100 |
| window      | sets maximal skip length between words   | 5 |
| sample         | sets threshold for occurrence of words. Those that appear with higher frequency in the training data will be randomly down-sampled; useful range is (0, 1e-5)      | 1e-3 |
| hs | 1 = use  Hierarchical Softmax | 0 |
| negative | number of negative examples; common values are 3 - 10 (0 = not used) | 5 |
| threads | number of used threads | 12 |
| iter | number of training iterations | 5 |
| minCount | 	This will discard words that appear less than *minCount* times | 5 |
| alpha | sets the starting learning rate  |  0.025 for skip-gram and 0.05 for CBOW |
| classes | output word classes rather than word vectors | 0 (vectors are written) |
| debug | sets debug mode  | 2 |
| saveVocab | the vocabulary will be saved to *saveVocab* value |  |
| readVocab | the vocabulary will be read from *readVocab* value , not constructed from the training data | |
| cbow | use the continuous bag of words model | 1 (use 0 for skip-gram model) |
